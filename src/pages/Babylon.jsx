      <h2>About Us</h2>
      <p>
        SGT Sausage Reporting for duty. We are a cured meat subscription service with a mission: to bring bold flavors and even bolder laughs to your doorstep. Blending top-tier charcuterie with military-grade comedy, this brand doesn’t just deliver salami—it delivers a full-on meat-tainment experience. Think camouflage packaging, pun-packed copy, and a no-nonsense mascot who takes snacks very seriously.
